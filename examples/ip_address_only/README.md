## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| names | A list of IP address resource names to create.  This is the GCP resource name and not the associated hostname of the IP address.  Existing resource names may be found with `gcloud compute addresses list` (e.g. ["gusw1-dev-fooapp-fe-0001-a-001-ip"]) | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| project\_id | The project ID to deploy to | `string` | n/a | yes |
| region | The region to deploy to | `string` | n/a | yes |
| subnetwork | The subnetwork on which the IP address will be reserved | `string` | n/a | yes |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| addresses | List of address values managed by this module (e.g. ["1.2.3.4"]) |
| names | List of address resource names managed by this module (e.g. ["gusw1-dev-fooapp-fe-0001-a-0001-ip"]) |
| project\_id | ID of the project being used |
| region | Region being used |
